    <h1>Am using the heading tag in html</h1>
    <h2>h1 is biggest and h6 is the smallest</h2>
    <h3>they make the text bold and bigger I suppose</h3>
    <h4>also h6 is way smalller than you think</h4>
    <h5>and h4 is basically normal text but bold</h5>
    <h6>this is pretty easy</h6>
    <p>
      now I am using the paragraph tag I dont really get its use am guessing
      that it makes the code more readable i suppose
